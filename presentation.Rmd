## Background
Around 735 million people faced hunger in 2022, and more than 3.1
billion people were unable to afford healthy diets in
2021. Between 2021 and 2022, progress was made
towards reducing hunger in Asia and Latin America, but
hunger is still on the rise in Africa, Caribbean and
Western Asia. (https://hlpf.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-09/Food%20Systems%20Transformation%20Brochure.pdf)

## The Local SDG Problem

Climate change is a key limiting factor towards  achievement of SDG2
- Through drought - agricultural production is affected (crop yields), promotes pest infestation,
affects availability of quality water resources, affects HH income 
All these consequently  undermine food security & improved nutrition



## Problem: Background, The Stats & Progress
- Where is Uganda under achieving
- Any other countries struggling ( potentially in the same region): point to scaling up our soulution
- Any countries doing better on that aspect 9 comparative stats
- What is the proposed solution ( based on the data)

## Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
```{r FIES,echo=FALSE,out.width = "80%",fig.cap="Food Insecurity Experience Scale"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fies.png")

```
## Introduction to the Solution

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}

```

## The SDGs

```{r sdg_images,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="The key SDGs", out.width = "30%"}
