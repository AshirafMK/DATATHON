## Background
**\textcolor{red}{Hunger}** is an uncomfortable or painful physical sensation caused by insufficient consumption of dietary energy. It becomes chronic when the person does not consume a sufficient amount of calories (dietary energy) on a regular basis to lead a normal, active and healthy life.

- For decades, FAO has used the \textcolor{blue}{Prevalence of Undernourishment} indicator to estimate the extent of hunger in the world, thus \textcolor{red}{“hunger”} may also be referred to as \textcolor{blue}{undernourishment}.

- Around 735 million people faced hunger in 2022, and more than 3.1
billion people were unable to afford healthy diets in 2021.

- Between 2021 and 2022, progress was made
towards reducing hunger in Asia and Latin America, but
hunger is still on the rise in Africa, Caribbean and
Western Asia. 

## Background

- The world’s food systems stand at the center of the
SDGs; however, food systems are under tremendous
stress from the persistence of global crises and conflict,
loss of biodiversity and climate change.

## The SDGs

**Transition:** Food Systems - Transforming food systems for a
sustainable world without hunger

## The Local SDG Problem

Climate change is a key limiting factor towards  achievement of SDG2
- Through drought - agricultural production is affected (crop yields), promotes pest infestation,
affects availability of quality water resources, affects HH income.

All these consequently  undermine food security & improved nutrition



## Problem: Background, The Stats & Progress
**(What we may include here)**

- Where is Uganda under achieving
- Any other countries struggling ( potentially in the same region): point to scaling up our soulution
- Any countries doing better on that aspect for comparative stats
- What is the proposed solution ( based on the data)

## Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
```{r FIES,echo=FALSE,out.width = "80%",fig.cap="Food Insecurity Experience Scale"}

```
## Introduction to the Solution
